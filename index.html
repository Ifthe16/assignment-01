                building practical projects to apply my skills. My goal is to create innovative, user-friendly web

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring content on
                        the web. It forms the backbone of all web pages, providing the essential framework that supports
                        other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. By learning HTML, I am gaining the skills to
                        structure web content effectively. </p>

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>CSS is the technology that brings life to HTML structures by controlling the presentation and
                        layout of web pages. By learning CSS, I am acquiring the skills to style and layout web content
                        effectively. This includes understanding selectors, properties, and values to apply styles to
                        HTML elements. With CSS, I can control everything from colors, fonts, and spacing to positioning
                        and responsiveness.</p>

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on
                        web pages. By learning JavaScript, I am equipping myself with the skills to add interactivity to
                        web pages. With JavaScript, I can handle user events, validate form inputs, and dynamically
                        update the content without requiring a page reload.</p>
